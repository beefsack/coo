Coo - Static web builder, with a vast range of supported languages
==================================================================

Coo is a customisable and flexible web content builder that aims to stay out of
your way.  The major goal is to support as many languages as possible without
any configuration, and a simple build config with sane defaults to concatenate
your scripts and compress for production.

For usage instructions, see the [Coo homepage](http://beefsack.github.com/coo).
